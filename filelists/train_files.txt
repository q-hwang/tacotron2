/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-00152.npy|The modern printer, in the teeth of the evidence given by his own eyes, considers the single page as the unit, and prints the page in the middle of his paper

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-03458.npy|But the affair still remained a profound mystery. No light was thrown upon it till, towards the end of March,

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-03462.npy|This brought suspicion on to a certain James Greenacre,

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04586.npy|There were still untoward accidents occasionally at executions, and even the chief practitioner of recent times, Calcraft,

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04589.npy|I may be permitted to digress for a moment to give a few particulars concerning the last officially appointed hangman of the city of London.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04590.npy|After Calcraft's resignation no successor was really appointed.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04591.npy|Marwood, whose name is so familiar with the present generation,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04592.npy|had no official status, and was merely an operator selected by the Corporation, and who, on the strength of it,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04593.npy|contracted with sheriffs and conveners to work by the job.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04594.npy|But Calcraft regularly succeeded Foxen, who followed Botting, and Dennis, the actor in the seventeen eighty riots.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04601.npy|The other accepted, and they got into conversation.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04602.npy|He told Calcraft that he was Foxen the executioner, and that he was that moment on his way to Newgate to hang a man,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04604.npy|"I have no idea who the sheriffs will get to do the work after me," said Foxen, adding that his assistant, Tom Cheshire,

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04606.npy|"I think I could do that sort of job," said Calcraft, on the spur of the moment.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04607.npy|Foxen asked him his name and address, and went away.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04610.npy|He accepted, having at first Tom Cheshire as his assistant, then for a time, when Cheshire was dismissed for drunkenness, a man named Osborne.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04611.npy|After that he worked alone.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04613.npy|It was customary to make the executioner take the Bible in his hand, and swear solemnly that he would dispatch every criminal condemned to die,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04615.npy|When he had taken the oath he was dismissed with the words, "Get thee hence, wretch!"
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04616.npy|Calcraft's emoluments were a guinea per week, and an extra guinea for every execution.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04617.npy|He got besides half-a-crown for every man he flogged, and an allowance to provide cats or birch rods.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04619.npy|he received a retaining fee of five pounds, five shillings, with the usual guinea for each job;
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04621.npy|It was not always easy to get a hangman so cheap, as I have already indicated on a previous page.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04622.npy|The onus and responsibility of carrying out the sentence is personal to the sheriff. A good story is told illustrating this.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04626.npy|Calcraft's salary was more than the proverbial "thirteenpence halfpenny -- hangman's wages."
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04629.npy|The mark was valued at thirteenpence halfpenny, or rather more than the shilling, which from time immemorial had been the hangman's wages.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04640.npy|To this curious etiquette was due the appointment of an official whose office has long since disappeared, "the yeoman of the halter,"
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04641.npy|whose business it was to provide the rope and do the pinioning, and who was paid a fee of five shillings.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04643.npy|He kept no record of them, and when asked questions, referred to the officers of the jail.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04645.npy|When he came to the prison for his wages his grandchildren often accompanied him, affectionately clinging to his hands;
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-04649.npy|He was so much in favor of short drops that his immediate successor, Marwood, stigmatized him as "short-drop" man.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05581.npy|was the variety of views as regards the discipline to be introduced in these new prisons. The time was one

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05603.npy|Separation was injurious to health, mental or physical, said one side; men broke down when subjected to it for more than a certain period,

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05612.npy|There was an absolute want of uniformity in dietaries; in some prisons it was too liberal, in others too low.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05614.npy|The cells inhabited by prisoners were of very varying dimensions;
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05615.npy|some were not sufficiently ventilated, others were warmed artificially, and were unwholesomely close.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05616.npy|The use of gas or some other means of lighting might be adopted, but more often was dispensed with.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05633.npy|and the question was once more taken up in the House of Commons. In eighteen forty-nine Mr. Charles Pearson, M.P.,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05634.npy|moved for a committee to report upon the best means of securing some uniform system which should be "punitive, reformatory, and self-supporting;"
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05635.npy|but the session was far advanced, and the matter was relegated to the following year.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05636.npy|In eighteen fifty Sir George Grey brought forward a new motion to the same effect,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05637.npy|which was promptly carried, with the additional instruction to the committee to suggest any improvements.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05638.npy|The latter had reference more especially to a proposal emanating from Mr. Charles Pearson himself.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05641.npy|His plan was to devote the whole labor of prisoners sentenced to any term between three months and four years to agriculture.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05643.npy|The prisoners were to cultivate the land and raise sufficient produce for their own support.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05644.npy|Mr. Pearson backed up his recommendations by many sound arguments.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05645.npy|Field labor, he urged, and with reason, was a very suitable employment;
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05646.npy|healthful, easily learnt, and well adapted to the circumstances of unskilled laborers.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05647.npy|Such excellent returns might be counted upon, that a margin of profit would be left after the cost of the prisons had been defrayed.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05648.npy|The scheme was no doubt fascinating, and in many respects feasible;
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05650.npy|In his proposal he dwelt much upon the humanizing effects of healthful open-air toil,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05651.npy|anticipating the best results from a system which made earnings, and indeed release, dependent upon the amount of work done.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05654.npy|but Mr. Pearson hardly considered the converse sufficiently, and
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05655.npy|omitted the fact that he might have to deal with that persistent idleness which is not an unknown characteristic of the criminal class.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05656.npy|The hope of reward might do much, but no system of penal discipline is complete unless it can also count upon the fear of punishment.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05661.npy|The creation of an expensive staff for supervision,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05662.npy|or the still more costly process of walling in the whole farm, would have greatly added to the charges of these establishments.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05663.npy|I have lingered too long perhaps over Mr. Pearson's proposal, but some reference was indispensable to a scheme
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05666.npy|Mr. Pearson and the committee of eighteen fifty have the more claim on our consideration, because,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05667.npy|in the inquiry which followed, attention was again attracted to Newgate.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05670.npy|There was no longer, or at worst but rarely, and for short periods, the same overcrowding.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05671.npy|This was obviated by the frequent sessions of the Central Criminal Court, and the utilization of the two subsidiary prisons in Giltspur Street and Southwark.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05672.npy|The prison population of Newgate was still subject to great fluctuations, but it seldom rose above two hundred and fifty or three hundred

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05677.npy|now seldom contained more than ten or a dozen each. Some sort of decorum was maintained among the occupants in the day-time.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05680.npy|But reformation was only skin deep. Below the surface many of the old evils still rankled.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05681.npy|There was as yet no control over the prisoners after locking-up time;
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05682.npy|this occurred in summer at eight, but in the winter months it took place at dusk, and was often as early as four or five.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05683.npy|The prisoners were still left to themselves till next morning's unlocking,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05684.npy|and they spent some fourteen or fifteen hours in total darkness, and almost without check or control.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05685.npy|Captain Williams, who was the inspector of prisons for the home district in succession to Messrs. Crawford and Russell,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05686.npy|stated in evidence that he was visiting Newgate one night, when he heard a great disturbance in one of the day and sleeping rooms,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05687.npy|and on entering it found the prisoners engaged in kicking bundles of wood from one end of the ward to the other.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05688.npy|Some attempt at supervision was exercised by the night watchman stationed on the leads, who might hear what went on inside.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05689.npy|If any disturbance reached his ears, he reported the case to the governor, who next morning visited the ward in fault, and asked for the culprit.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05690.npy|The enforcement of discipline depended upon the want of honor among thieves.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05691.npy|Unless the guilty prisoner was given up, the whole ward was punished, either by the exclusion of visitors or the deprivation of fire,

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05698.npy|Thus the wards, which, as I have said, were left in complete darkness, were now to be lighted with gas; and after this most salutary addition,

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05704.npy|and one or two men were allowed to mend clothes and make shoes. The rules made by the Secretary of State were hung up in conspicuous parts of the prison;
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05705.npy|more officers were appointed, as the time of so many of those already on the staff was monopolized by attendance at the Central Criminal Court.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05706.npy|Another custom which had led to disorder was abolished;
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05707.npy|prisoners who had been acquitted were not permitted to return to the prison to show their joy and receive the congratulations of their unfortunate fellows.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05721.npy|seeing that since the establishment of the Central Criminal Court, Newgate received prisoners for trial from several counties,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05723.npy|He forwarded plans prepared by the inspectors of prisons, not for blind adoption, but as a guide.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05724.npy|This plan was on the principle of cellular separation, a system, according to Lord John Russell, desirable in all prisons,

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05727.npy|The court was, however, prepared to consider Lord John Russell's proposal with regard to the cost of rebuilding;

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05730.npy|A proviso was also made that the magistrates should continue to exercise full control over the new jail,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05733.npy|and on a more mature consideration he realized that the limited area of the existing Newgate site,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05734.npy|and the costliness of enlarging it, forbade all idea of entirely reconstructing the jail so as to constitute it a model prison.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05736.npy|to select a sufficiently spacious piece of ground, and erect a prison which from foundations to roofs should be in conformity with the newest ideas.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05738.npy|But the condition of the great city jail was evidently considered a reproach by the city authorities, and a year after the opening of the new "model" at Pentonville,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05739.npy|a serious effort was made to reconstruct Newgate.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05741.npy|This jail was nominally to replace the Giltspur Street Compter,

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05857.npy|On the other hand, new and careful regulations were framed to secure the moral and material well-being of the inmates of the jails.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05858.npy|The law made it imperative that every prison should have a prison chapel, and that daily and Sunday services should be held.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05859.npy|The chaplain's duties were enlarged, and the principle of toleration accepted to the extent of securing to all prisoners

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05862.npy|No less close was the care as regards preservation of health.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05863.npy|Stringent rules were prescribed for the prison surgeons;

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05874.npy|while decency and good order were to be insured by the strict prohibition of gambling and drunkenness.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05877.npy|So was the employment of prisoners in any position of trust or authority;
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05878.npy|they were not to be turnkeys or assistant turnkeys, neither wardsman nor yardsman, overseer,

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05880.npy|The Act of eighteen sixty-five also encouraged and empowered the local authorities to "alter, enlarge, or rebuild" their prisons.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05892.npy|The Secretary of State was empowered to deal rather summarily with "inadequate" prisons, in other words,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05894.npy|He could in the first place withhold the government grant in aid of prison funds by refusing the certificate to the Treasury upon which the allowance was paid.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05901.npy|It was necessary, for instance, to give due notice when the government grant was to be withdrawn,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05902.npy|and with the warning a copy of the particular defects and allegations was to be sent to the local authority.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05903.npy|The latter too was to be laid before the House of Commons.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05904.npy|In the same way, six months' notice was required in cases where the closing of a prison was contemplated;
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05905.npy|but if these conditions were observed, the Secretary of State could deal sharply enough with the defaulting jurisdictions.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-05906.npy|Yet the law was seldom if ever enforced.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06141.npy|Let me call your attention to the fact that the national Industrial Recovery Act
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06142.npy|gave businessmen the opportunity they had sought for years to improve business conditions through what has been called self-government in industry.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06144.npy|if they have gone too far in such matters as price fixing and limitation of production,

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06156.npy|we have reached into the heart of the problem which is to provide such annual earnings for the lowest paid worker as will meet his minimum needs.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06585.npy|We must have men worthy and equipped to carry out impartial justice.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06604.npy|By bringing into the judicial system a steady and continuing stream of new and younger blood, I hope, first,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06605.npy|to make the administration of all federal justice speedier and, therefore, less costly;
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06606.npy|secondly, to bring to the decision of social and economic problems younger men who have had personal experience and contact

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06609.npy|The number of judges to be appointed would depend wholly on the decision of present judges now over seventy,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06612.npy|no additional place would be created.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06619.npy|Why was the age fixed at seventy?
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06620.npy|Because the laws of many states, the practice of the Civil Service, the regulations of the Army and Navy,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06621.npy|and the rules of many of our universities and of almost every great private business enterprise,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06622.npy|commonly fix the retirement age at seventy years or less.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06623.npy|The statute would apply to all the courts in the federal system.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06625.npy|The plan has met opposition only so far as the Supreme Court of the United States itself is concerned.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06633.npy|that no President fit for his office would appoint,

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06641.npy|then I say that I and with me the vast majority of the American people favor doing just that thing -- now.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06642.npy|Is it a dangerous precedent for the Congress to change the number of the justices? The Congress has always had, and will have, that power.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06752.npy|Cuvier devotes a special section to the Division of Organized Beings into Animals and Vegetables,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06756.npy|and inanimated beings, which are devoid of these functions and simply vegetable.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06757.npy|Although the roots of plants direct themselves toward moisture and their leaves toward air and light,

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06761.npy|reduces the necessity of the existence in them of an alimentary cavity, or reservoir of food,

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06799.npy|Agardh and other of the botanists of Cuvier's generation who occupied themselves with the lower plants had observed that,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06800.npy|under particular circumstances, the contents of the cells of certain water-weeds were set free and moved about with considerable velocity
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06801.npy|and with all the appearances of spontaneity as locomotive bodies,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06802.npy|which, from their similarity to animals of simple organization, were called "zoospores."
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06803.npy|Even as late as eighteen forty-five, however, a botanist of Schleiden's eminence dealt very skeptically with these statements,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06805.npy|had declared the greater number of what are now recognized as locomotive plants to be animals.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06806.npy|"At the present day," writes Huxley,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06807.npy|innumerable plants and free plant cells are known to pass the whole or part of their lives in an actively locomotive condition,

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06812.npy|has broken down, so far, at least, as his mode of stating it goes. And

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06819.npy|has no permanent digestive cavity or mouth, but takes in its food anywhere and digests, so to speak, all over its body.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06822.npy|And if we substitute for the possession of an alimentary cavity the power of taking solid nutriment into the body and there digesting it,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06823.npy|the definition so changed will cover all animals, except certain parasites,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06824.npy|and the few and exceptional cases of non-parasitic animals which do not feed at all.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06825.npy|On the other hand, the definition thus amended will exclude all ordinary vegetable organisms.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06827.npy|The third distinction is based on a completely erroneous conception of the chemical differences
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06829.npy|as it was current among contemporary chemists.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06831.npy|and that the latter is, chemically speaking, just as complicated as the former.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06833.npy|once supposed to be exclusively confined to plants, are now known to be regular and normal products of animals.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06835.npy|Cellulose is widespread as a constituent of the skeletons of the lower animals
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06840.npy|yet the exact researches of the modern chemical investigators of the physiological processes of plants have clearly demonstrated the fallacy
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06841.npy|of attempting to draw any general distinction between animals and vegetables on this ground. In fact, the difference vanishes with the sunshine,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06842.npy|even in the case of the green plant, which in the dark absorbs oxygen and gives out carbonic acid like any animal.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06843.npy|On the other hand, those plants, such as the fungi,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06844.npy|which contain no chlorophyll and are not green, are always, so far as respiration is concerned, in the exact position of animals.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06845.npy|They absorb oxygen and give out carbonic acid.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06847.npy|has been as completely invalidated as the third and second, and even the first can be retained only in a modified form
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06848.npy|and subject to exceptions.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06849.npy|But has the advance of biology simply tended to break down old distinctions without establishing new ones?
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06856.npy|and that, however diverse may be the fabrics or tissues of which their bodies are composed, all these varied structures result
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06859.npy|but present a close resemblance when those of animals and those of plants are compared together.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06860.npy|The contractility which is the fundamental condition of locomotion," continues Huxley,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06861.npy|has not only been discovered to exist far more widely among plants than was formerly imagined,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06864.npy|comparable to that which was found by Du Bois Reymond to be a concomitant of the activity of ordinary muscle in animals. Again,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06866.npy|can be distinguished from those acts of contraction following upon stimuli, which are called "reflex" in animals.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06867.npy|On each lobe of the bi-lobed leaf of Venus flytrap are three delicate filaments which stand out at right angles from the surface of the leaf.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06868.npy|Touch one of them with the end of a fine human hair
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06869.npy|and the lobes of the leaf instantly close together in virtue of an act of contraction of part of their substance,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06870.npy|just as the body of a snail contracts into its shell when one of its "horns" is irritated.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06873.npy|is propagated to the muscles by which the body is retracted, and causing them to contract, the act of retraction is brought about.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06874.npy|Of course the similarity of the acts does not necessarily involve the conclusion that the mechanism by which they are effected is the same
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06875.npy|but it suggests a suspicion of their identity which needs careful testing.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06877.npy|converge toward the conclusion that the nerve fibers, which have been regarded as ultimate elements of nervous tissue,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06878.npy|are not such, but are simply the visible aggregations of vastly more attenuated filaments,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06879.npy|the diameter of which dwindles down to the limits of our present microscopic vision,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06880.npy|greatly as these have been extended by modern improvements of the microscope, and that a nerve is, in its essence,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06881.npy|nothing but a linear tract of specially modified protoplasm between two points of an organism
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06884.npy|And the question whether plants are provided with a nervous system or not thus acquires a new aspect and presents the histologist and physiologist
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06885.npy|with a problem of extreme difficulty, which must be attacked from a new point of view and by the aid of methods which have yet to be invented.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06886.npy|"Thus it must be admitted," he says again, "that plants may be contractile and locomotive;
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06887.npy|that, while locomotive, their movements may have as much appearance of spontaneity as those of the lowest animals,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06888.npy|and that many exhibit actions comparable to those which are brought about by the agency of a nervous system in animals.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06889.npy|And it must be allowed to be possible that further research may reveal the existence of something comparable to a nervous system in plants.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06890.npy|So that I know not where we can hope to find any absolute distinction between animals and plants, unless we return to their mode of nutrition
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06891.npy|and inquire whether certain differences of a more occult character than those imagined to exist by Cuvier,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06892.npy|and which certainly hold good for the vast majority of animals and plants, are of universal application.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06911.npy|The watery solution, in which its roots are plunged, contains nitrogen but no carbon;
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06913.npy|but its nitrogen is in the state of a free gas, in which condition the bean can make no use of it,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-06914.npy|and the chlorophyll is the apparatus by which the carbon is extracted from the atmospheric carbonic acid, the leaves being the chief laboratories

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-07107.npy|First, it must be noted that some structures are not non-adaptive, that is, do not change to fit changed habits or conditions of life.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-12778.npy|the Commission received a number of proposals designed to improve current arrangements for protecting the President.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-12880.npy|which was the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the President.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-12891.npy|the Secret Service had received from the FBI some nine thousand reports on members of the Communist Party.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-12896.npy|They emphasized the necessity that the information now being furnished be handled with judgment and care.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-12900.npy|In June nineteen sixty-four, the Secret Service sent to a number of Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-12913.npy|It is questionable whether such criteria would have resulted in the referral of Oswald to the Secret Service.

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13029.npy|Although Chief Rowley does not complain about the pay scale for Secret Service agents,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13030.npy|salaries are below those of the FBI and leading municipal police forces.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13033.npy|Chief Rowley testified that the present workload of each Secret Service agent averages one hundred ten point one cases.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13034.npy|While these statistics relate to the activities of Secret Service agents stationed in field offices and not the White House detail,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13038.npy|In its budget request for the fiscal year beginning July one, nineteen sixty-four,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13040.npy|Chief Rowley explained that this would not provide enough additional manpower to take all the measures which he considers required.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13041.npy|However, the nineteen sixty-four to sixty-five budget request was submitted in November nineteen sixty-three
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13042.npy|and requests for additional personnel were not made because of the studies then being conducted.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13043.npy|The Secret Service has now presented its recommendations to the Bureau of the Budget. The plan proposed by the Service
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13045.npy|The plan provides for an additional two hundred five agents for the Secret Service. Seventeen of this number are proposed for the Protective Research Section;
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13046.npy|one hundred forty-five are proposed for the field offices to handle the increased volume of security investigations
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13047.npy|and be available to protect the President or Vice President when they travel;
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13049.npy|in case of unexpected need; and twenty-five additional agents are recommended to provide the Vice President full protection.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13050.npy|The Commission urges that the Bureau of the Budget review these recommendations with the Secret Service and authorize a request for the necessary supplemental appropriation,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13051.npy|as soon as it can be justified. The Congress has often stressed that it will support any reasonable request for funds for the protection of the President.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13052.npy|Manpower and Technical Assistance From Other Agencies
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13054.npy|to assist in its protection functions.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13056.npy|It has used other Treasury law enforcement agents on special experiments in building and route surveys in places to which the President frequently travels.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13057.npy|It has also used other Federal law enforcement agents during Presidential visits to cities in which such agents are stationed.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13058.npy|Thus, in the four months following the assassination,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13059.npy|the FBI, on sixteen separate occasions, supplied a total of one hundred thirty-nine agents to assist in protection work during a Presidential visit,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13061.npy|From February eleven through June thirty, nineteen sixty-four,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13062.npy|the Service had the advantage of nine thousand, five hundred hours of work by other enforcement agencies.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13063.npy|The FBI has indicated that it is willing to continue to make such assistance available,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13064.npy|even though it agrees with the Secret Service that it is preferable for the Service to have enough agents to handle all protective demands.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13065.npy|The Commission endorses these efforts to supplement the Service's own personnel by obtaining, for short periods of time,
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13066.npy|the assistance of trained Federal law enforcement officers.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13068.npy|which would permit it to provide adequate protective manpower for all situations.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13070.npy|and the Secret Service enter into a formal agreement defining such arrangements.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13071.npy|It may eventually be desirable to codify the practice in an Executive order.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13075.npy|that the job of protecting the President has not been and cannot be exclusively the responsibility of the Secret Service.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13076.npy|The Secret Service in the past has sometimes guarded its right to be acknowledged as the sole protector of the Chief Executive.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13077.npy|This no longer appears to be the case.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13079.npy|Recognition that the responsibility must be shared increases the likelihood that it will be met.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13082.npy|the Secret Service has been receiving full cooperation in scientific research and technological development
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13083.npy|from many Government agencies including the Department of Defense and the President's Office of Science and Technology.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13086.npy|The Commission recommends that the present arrangements

/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13089.npy|between Secretary Dillon and Donald F. Hornig, Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, is a useful effort in the right direction.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13090.npy|The Service should negotiate a memorandum of understanding with each agency that has been assisting it and from which it can expect to need help in the future.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13092.npy|This Commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection of our Presidents which will guarantee security.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13093.npy|The demands on the President in the execution of His responsibilities in today's world are so varied and complex
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13094.npy|and the traditions of the office in a democracy such as ours are so deep-seated as to preclude absolute security.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13095.npy|The Commission has, however, from its examination of the facts of President Kennedy's assassination
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13097.npy|materially improve upon the procedures in effect at the time of President Kennedy's assassination and result in a substantial lessening of the danger.
/datasets/ljspeech/processed_wavenet/ljspeech-mel-13098.npy|As has been pointed out, the Commission has not resolved all the proposals which could be made. The Commission nevertheless is confident that,
